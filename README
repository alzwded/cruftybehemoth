==== CRUFTY BEHEMOTH ====

== 1. Info ==
Basic, abstract, generic 2D gaming framework.

Provides resource management and main loop.

== 2. Building ==
Do a make to build the demo. Do a make framework-lib to generate libframework.so in ./lib.

== 3. Future ==
Implement OpenMP parallelization for AI loops and drawing an entity to a temp buffer to have the main thread compose everything in the end (it sounds less optimal than I actually have in mind.)

== 4. TODO ==
* documentation
* dist make target which includes the necessary headers
