    returns the resource instance for that thing

Resource:
+Load(string path) virtual
    loads the particularities from this file
-Unload() virtual
    called by ResourceManager
-operator--
    decrease ref count, when reaches 0 call Drop
    called by SP_base's destructor
-Drop()
    call ResourceManager->AddToBlackList(this)
m_listOfDatas: IntrusiveList<SP_base>
    the instances spawned by this resource -- used for serialization
m_rc: int
    querried by ResourceManager to decide if it should be killed or not
:private constructor, only callable by friendly classes hereunder
:private destructor, only callable by ResourceManager
